<p>One upon a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poodle tree sock turtle sandwich trampoline">time</span>, a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="robot giraffe Martian circus-performer chess-player dragon">boy</span> named Aladdin found an old <span class="switchable" data-altWords="trophy teapot music-box trumpet toaster">lamp</span> in a cave. He brought it home and <span class="switchable" data-altWords="danced shook sneezed yodeled spun jumped">rubbed</span> off the dirt. Suddenly a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="gorgeous silly serious bashful clumsy cheerful">hideous</span> genie appeared and said, “Make a wish! Anything at all!”</p>
<p>It just so happened that Aladdin loved the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poet astronaut president ballerina opera-singer skateboarder">princess</span> who lived in the palace. She was so <span class="switchable" data-altWords="clever goofy strong graceful brave friendly">beautiful</span>. “Genie,” Aladdin said, “I want forty baksets of <span class="switchable" data-altWords="baseballs sardines books marshmallows calculators pudding">jewels</span> to prove my love to the Sultan, her <span class="switchable" data-altWords="karate-teacher dalmation mother backup-singer best-friend goldfish">father</span>.” The genie granted the wish for <span class="switchable" data-altWords="baseballs sardines books marshmallows calculators pudding">jewels</span>, plus some <span class="switchable" data-altWords="bicycles llamas wagons wheelbarrows golf-carts hoverboards">horses</span> to carry it all to the palace.</p>
<p>The Sultan was delighted by the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="baseballs sardines books marshmallows calculators pudding">jewels</span> and quickly called the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poet astronaut president ballerina opera-singer skateboarder">princess</span>, who was <span class="switchable" data-altWords="dancing singing writing rollerskating painting bowling">sitting</span> in another room. The <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poet astronaut president ballerina opera-singer skateboarder">princess</span> walked in, saw Aladdin, and was instantly <span class="switchable" data-altWords="amused curious talkative smiling inquisitive competitive">charmed</span>. They had a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="barbecue parade spelling-bee concert Monopoly-tournament pie-eating-contest">wedding</span> that very night and continue to throw <span class="switchable" data-altWords="picnic beach videogame trapeze knitting star-gazing">dance</span> parties for all of the creatures of the land.</p>
