  <storyTitle> The Princess and the Pea </storyTitle>
  <author> Cynthia Shur Petts </author>
  <p>Once upon a [time, poodle, tree, sock, turtle, sandwich, trampoline] there was a [prince, lion tamer, baseball player, teacher, magician, scientist, wizard] who wanted to [marry, meet, arm wrestle, dance with, sing for, impress, interview, email] a
    real [princess, explorer, artist, poet, inventor, scuba diver]. He [travelled, flew, ran, danced, skated, bounced, swam, rocketed] all over the world to find one, but had no luck.</p>
  <p>One [stormy, hot, boring, cold, vacation, quiet, cozy] evening, a woman knocked at the city gate. The rain and [wind, snowflakes, frogs, candy, butterflies, mashed potatoes] made her look quite a mess, but she said that she was a real [princess, explorer,
    artist, poet, inventor, scuba diver].</p>
  <p>"We’'ll soon find out," thought the [queen, security guard, jester, astronaut, chef, babysitter, judge]. She went into the bedroom and put a [pea, thimble, M&M, marble, book, cactus, seashell, penny, bicycle] under twenty mattresses and twenty blankets.
    The [princess, explorer, artist, poet, inventor, scuba diver] climbed onto the mattresses to go to sleep.</p>
  <p>In the morning the [princess, explorer, artist, poet, inventor, scuba diver] said, "I couldn’t sleep! I was lying on something uncomfortable!” Nobody but a real [princess, explorer, artist, poet, inventor, scuba diver] could feel a [pea, thimble, M&M,
    marble, book, cactus, seashell, penny, bicycle] under twenty mattresses and blankets, so the [prince, lion tamer, baseball player, teacher, magician, scientist, wizard] [married, thanked, clapped for, sang for, drew, smiled at, cooked for] her. The
    [pea, thimble, M&M, marble, book, cactus, seashell, penny, bicycle] was put in a [museum, house, antfarm, swimming pool, puddle, grocery store, purse], where it can still be seen, if no one has [stolen, eaten, lost, grabbed, hidden, smooshed, stepped
    on, sneezed on] it. </p>
