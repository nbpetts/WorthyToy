<p>Once upon a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poodle tree sock turtle sandwich trampoline">time</span> there was a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="baseball-player potato-farmer magician scientist wizard librarian">prince</span> who wanted to <span class="switchable" data-altWords="cook-for arm-wrestle dance-with sing-for interview email">marry</span> a real <span class="switchable" data-altWords="explorer artist lumberjack inventor scuba-diver zookeeper">princess</span>. He <span class="switchable" data-altWords="flew ran boogied skated bounced swam">travelled</span> all over the world to find one, but had no luck. </p>
<p>One <span class="switchable" data-altWords="hot boring cold strange quiet cozy">stormy</span> evening, a woman knocked at the city gate. The rain and <span class="switchable" data-altWords="frogs gummy-bears mothballs mashed- turnips pinecones spaghetti">wind</span> made her look quite a mess, but she said that she was a real <span class="switchable" data-altWords="explorer artist lumberjack inventor scuba-diver zookeeper">princess</span>.</p>
<p>"We’'ll soon find out," thought the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="security-guard jester captain ringmaster babysitter judge">queen</span>. She went into the bedroom and put a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="thimble marble cactus seashell penny bicycle">pea</span> under twenty mattresses and twenty blankets.</p>
<p>The next morning, the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="explorer artist lumberjack inventor scuba-diver zookeeper">princess</span> exclaimed, "I couldn’t sleep! There was a huge lump in my mattress!” Only a real <span class="switchable" data-altWords="explorer artist lumberjack inventor scuba-diver zookeeper">princess</span> could feel a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="thimble marble cactus seashell penny bicycle">pea</span> under twenty mattresses and blankets, so the <span class="switchable" data-altWords="baseball-player potato-farmer magician scientist wizard librarian">prince</span> immediately <span class="switchable" data-altWords="cooked-for arm-wrestled danced-with sang-for interviewed emailed">married</span> her. The <span class="switchable" data-altWords="thimble marble cactus seashell penny bicycle">pea</span> was put in a museum, where it can still be seen, if no one has <span class="switchable" data-altWords="eaten lost hidden smooshed stepped-on buried">stolen</span> it.</p>
