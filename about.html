<article class="about">
  <p>While living and working in the UK theatre community, I became fascinated by how they were using gaming in connection to performance. Online games were a great way for audiences to engage with a show beforehand and to continue the conversation afterwards. I’ve always been a fan of games, so I wanted to learn more about how we could create our own. We hoped to make a game that would engage players in thinking outside of traditional narratives.
  </p>
  <p>In the Fall of 2014 I reached out to my friend, Nathan Petts, who is a brilliant software developer (and phenomenal performer!) and asked him about teaming up on the creation of our first ever game at Adventure Stage. He was excited to embrace the challenge of collaborating on a word based game, encouraging young people to make new stories in response to the themes tackled in Worthy.</p>

  <p>After many meetings, emails, phone calls, beta tests, and support from a fantastic creative team who compiled stories, we’re proud to share Worthy Words with you! We hope it sparks some interesting discussion around what it means to create stories we want to hear when empowered with a choice.</p>

  <p class="valediction ">Enjoy the game and we look forward to seeing you at the show! Your team,
