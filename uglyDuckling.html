        <p>Once upon a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="poodle tree sock turtle sandwich trampoline">time</span>, an <span class="switchable" data-altWords="oreo-cookie eggplant umbrella envelope igloo ice-cream-sandwich">egg</span> cracked in a mother duck’s nest and a duckling came out that was different than the others. The animals laughed at him and called him <span class="switchable" data-altWords="bossy goofy hairy smelly sneaky squeaky">ugly</span>, so he ran away. He flew and <span class="switchable" data-altWords="galloped jumped twirled slid tumbled tap-danced">flew</span> until a storm came up, and he was too tired to fly anymore. He landed on the ground and snuck into a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="bakery theater firehouse church wig-store nail-salon"> cottage</span>. He was <span class="switchable" data-altWords="glamorous peaceful cheerful creative crafty confident">warm</span> there, so he stayed through winter, but he missed the water.</p>
        <p>When spring came he said, “I must go out into the world again!" and he flew until he came to a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="bowling-alley forest field stadium department-store tennis-court">garden</span> with a stream. There were three <span class="switchable" data-altWords="courageous sassy quirky burly studious thoughtful">beautiful</span> swans in the water. The duckling had never seen anything like them, and <span class="switchable" data-altWords="galloped jumped twirled slid tumbled tap-danced">flew</span>over to see them better.</p>
        <p>As he landed in the water he saw his reflection, and discovered he was no longer an ugly duckling. He was a <span class="switchable" data-altWords="courageous sassy quirky burly studious thoughtful">beautiful</span> swan, just like the others! The swans <span class="switchable" data-altWords="cheered-for applauded bowed-to did-a-jig-for serenaded saved-a-seat-for">welcomed</span> him, and children ran over to throw <span class="switchable" data-altWords="M&Ms cucumbers tacos sprinkles lemonade ketchup">bread</span> in the water. The sun was warm and <span class="switchable" data-altWords="festive sparkly musical hopeful mischievous sleepy">bright</span>, and the swan, who knew he wasn’t really <span class="switchable" data-altWords="bossy goofy hairy smelly sneaky squeaky">ugly</span>, was the happiest he had ever been.</p>
